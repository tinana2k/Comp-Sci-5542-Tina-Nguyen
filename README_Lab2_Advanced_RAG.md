- **Relevant Evidence (keywords / entities / constraints):**  
- **Correct Answer Criteria (1–2 bullets):**  

### Q2
- **Query:**  
- **Relevant Evidence (keywords / entities / constraints):**

## 3. System Design

- **Chunking Strategy:** Fixed / Semantic  
- **Chunk Size / Overlap:**  
- **Embedding Model:**  
- **Vector Store / Index:** (FAISS / Chroma / Other)  
- **Keyword Retriever:** (TF-IDF / BM25)  
- **Hybrid α Value(s):**  
- **Re-ranking Method:** (Cross-Encoder / LLM Judge / None)  

### Design Rationale
*(3–5 sentences explaining why you chose these system settings and how they affect performance, latency, or accuracy.)*

## 4. Results

| Query | Method (Keyword / Vector / Hybrid) | Precision@5 | Recall@10 |
|-------|-----------------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Q1    |                                   |             |           |

## 5. Failure Case

- **What failed?**  
- **Which layer failed?** (Chunking / Retrieval / Re-ranking / Generation)  
- **Proposed system-level fix:**

## 6. Evidence of Grounding

Provide one example of a **RAG-grounded answer with citations**:

> **Answer:**  
> *(Paste answer here)*  
>  
> **Citations:** [Chunk 1], [Chunk 2]
